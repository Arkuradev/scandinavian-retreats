## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Clone repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arkuradev/holidaze-retreats.git
cd holidaze-retreats
npm install
```

### local env file (`.env.local`)

```bash
VITE_NOROFF_API_KEY="add_your_api_key_here"
VITE_BASE_API_URL="https://v2.api.noroff.dev"
```

### ⚠️ Important

If you rename any of these environment variables, you must also update the references inside your
`apiFetch` (or equivalent API utility).
Your fetch wrapper expects:

```ts
import.meta.env.VITE_BASE_API_URL;
import.meta.env.VITE_NOROFF_API_KEY;
```

> 🔒 Your `.env.local` file should never be committed to Git. It is ignored by default via `.gitignore`.

### Start dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Check build for production

```bash
npm run build
```
